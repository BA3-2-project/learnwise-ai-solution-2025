## Business Objectives

The goal is to develop an AI-powered personalized learning system that: 
− Reduce Educator Workload: Reduce the time educators spend on manual 
content customization and progress tracking by 30%. 
− Improve Student Academic Performance: Increase the average student score on 
a set of standardized assessments by at least 10% within the first year of 
implementation.   
−  Optimize maintenance costs through proactive and data-driven decision-making.   
−  Boost Student Engagement: Achieve a 20% increase in average time spent on 
learning activities per student per week. 
−  Demonstrate a practical AI solution that balances academic rigor with real-world 
impact. 


Success Criteria: 
− High User Adoption: The system achieves a user adoption rate of over 80% for 
both students and educators in the target schools within six months.   
− Deliver a fully functional prototype integrated with simulated industrial sensor 
data.   
− Ensure that results and decision-making outputs are transparent and explainable 
to end users.   
− Measurable Academic Growth: Student performance metrics (e.g., test scores, 
grades) show a statistically significant improvement. 
− Positive Feedback Loop: The AI models show continuous improvement in prediction 
accuracy and recommendation relevance, as evidenced by user satisfaction 
surveys and model performance metrics (R2, MSE).


Requirements:  
− The solution must have a secure, multi-user web interface; a robust database for 
data   storage and retrieval; and a modular, scalable architecture to 
accommodate future   growth and feature additions.  


Risks: 
− Data Privacy and Security: The risk of a data breach is significant. We will 
mitigate this with robust encryption, access controls, and strict adherence to data 
privacy regulations.   
− Model Overfitting: The predictive model may perform well in testing but poorly in 
real-world deployment.   
−  Time Constraints: Limited development time before the project deadline may 
impact feature completeness.   
−  Technical Challenges: Integration of multiple AI techniques (ML, DL, NLP) could 
cause delays.  
− User Resistance: Educators and students may be hesitant to adopt the new 
technology. This will be addressed through comprehensive training, a user
friendly design, and ongoing support.   
− Algorithmic Bias: The AI models may inadvertently learn and reinforce biases 
present in the training data, potentially leading to unfair recommendations. This 
will be mitigated through regular audits of the model's outputs and a focus on 
creating a diverse and representative training dataset.


Constraints: 
−  Initial development is limited by a fixed budget and a small team. The system 
must be deployable on standard cloud infrastructure, and it must operate 
independently of existing legacy school systems initially. 
− Timeframe: Project must be completed by 13 October 2025.   
−  Resources: Limited to publicly available or simulated data and open-source 
tools.   
− Team Capacity: Work is divided among six members, with academic workload 
alongside project.   
−  Ethical Boundaries: AI solution must comply with ethical standards, avoiding 
bias and ensuring data privacy. 


Initial Assessment of Tools and Techniques: 
− Programming Language: Python will be the primary language due to its strong 
support for AI and data science libraries.  
− Database: A relational database like SQLite will be used for the initial prototype 
due to its ease of use and local file-based storage. For a production environment, 
this would be upgraded to a scalable cloud database like Firebase 
− AI/ML Libraries: We will use Scikit-learn for our core machine learning models 
(e.g., Random Forest) and NLTK for basic NLP tasks. If deep learning is needed, 
we will use TensorFlow or PyTorch for their advanced capabilities.
