## Business Objectives

Goals
- Reduce industrial downtime by predicting equipment failures before they occur.  
- Optimize maintenance costs through proactive and data-driven decision-making.  
- Provide actionable insights that improve reliability, safety, and sustainability in industrial operations.  
- Demonstrate a practical AI solution that balances academic rigor with real-world impact.  

Success Criteria
- Achieve at least 80% accuracy in predicting equipment failures on test data.  
- Deliver a fully functional prototype integrated with simulated industrial sensor data.  
- Ensure that results and decision-making outputs are transparent and explainable to end users.  
- Receive positive evaluation during project presentation (21â€“23 October 2025) by meeting academic marking rubric standards.  

Risks
- Data Quality Issues: Simulated or public datasets may not fully represent real-world industrial environments.  
- Model Overfitting: The predictive model may perform well in testing but poorly in real-world deployment.  
- Time Constraints: Limited development time before project deadline may impact feature completeness.  
- Technical Challenges:Integration of multiple AI techniques (ML, DL, NLP) could cause delays.  

Constraints
- Timeframe: Project must be completed by 13 October 2025.  
- Resources:Limited to publicly available or simulated data and open-source tools.  
- Team Capacity:Work divided among six members, with academic workload alongside project.  
- Ethical Boundaries: AI solution must comply with ethical standards, avoiding bias and ensuring data privacy.
