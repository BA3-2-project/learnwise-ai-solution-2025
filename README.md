# LearnWise AI Solution 2025

Project Overview
This repository contains the documentation and source code for our Business Analysis 3.2 group project. Our solution leverages Artificial Intelligence to address a real-world challenge in the industrial sector, aligning with the theme: **“An AI Solution for Industries.”**

roblem Definition
In many industrial environments, inefficiencies in predictive maintenance lead to costly downtime and equipment failure. Our AI solution targets this issue by implementing a machine learning model that forecasts equipment breakdowns using historical sensor data. This empowers companies to act proactively, reducing costs and improving operational reliability.

Objectives
- Develop a Python-based AI model for predictive maintenance.
- Integrate time series analysis and anomaly detection.
- Demonstrate practical application through simulated industrial data.
- Ensure ethical AI use and data transparency.

 Technologies Used
- Python 3.11
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (for deep learning)
- GitHub Projects (for task tracking)
- Grammarly (for documentation quality assurance)

AI Techniques Applied
- Machine Learning (Random Forest, SVM)
- Time Series Analysis
- Deep Learning (LSTM)
- Natural Language Processing (for report generation)
- Chatbot integration (optional feature)

Data Sources
- Simulated industrial sensor data
- Public datasets from UCI Machine Learning Repository
